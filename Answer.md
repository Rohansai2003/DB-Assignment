Questions

1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Ans.The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is a many-to-one relationship.
This means that many products can belong to one category, but each product belongs to only one category.In the database schema provided:
In the "Product" table, the column category_id serves as a foreign key referencing the id column in the "Product_Category" table.
This establishes the relationship between the two tables.
Each product in the "Product" table has a category_id field that specifies the category to which it belongs.
Each category in the "Product_Category" table can have multiple products associated with it.
However, each product can only belong to one category.
This relationship reflects the hierarchical structure where products are organized into categories.
It allows for efficient organization and retrieval of products based on their categories.

3. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
   
Ans.To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce referential integrity using foreign key constraints. Here's how you can achieve this:
Define Foreign Key Constraint: In the "Product" table, the category_id column is already defined as a foreign key referencing the id column in the "Product_Category" table. Ensure that this foreign key constraint is properly defined in your database schema.
Enforce Referential Integrity: When defining the foreign key constraint, specify that it should enforce referential integrity. This means that any value entered into the category_id column in the "Product" table must exist in the id column of the "Product_Category" table.
Prevent Orphaned Records: By enforcing referential integrity, the database will prevent the insertion of records into the "Product" table with category_id values that do not exist in the "Product_Category" table. This ensures that each product is associated with a valid category.
Handle Updates and Deletes: Decide how to handle updates or deletes in the "Product_Category" table. You can either cascade changes, where updates or deletions in the "Product_Category" table propagate to related records in the "Product" table, or restrict changes, where updates or deletions in the "Product_Category" table are prevented if they would cause orphaned records in the "Product" table.
By implementing these steps, you can ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, maintaining data integrity within your database.
